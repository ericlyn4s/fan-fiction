## Description:

Tale Spin is a collaborative web application, serving as a fan-fiction forum, that allows users to sign up and sign in to the platform. Once logged in, users can share their movie review stories and interact with others by liking and commenting on stories shared by fellow users. The platform aims to provide a space for movie enthusiasts to connect, share their thoughts, and engage in discussions about their favorite films.

## Features:

- _User Authentication_: Users can create an account and securely log in using bcrypt for password hashing.
- _Story Sharing_: Registered users can share their movie review stories on the platform, while non-registered users can only view the reviews.
- _Interactivity_: Users can like and comment on stories shared by other users, fostering engagement and discussion.
- _Database Management_: The application utilizes MySQL as the relational database management system, managed through Sequelize ORM. The database schema includes tables for users, stories, likes, and comments.
- _Session Management_: Express-session middleware is used for session management, providing a seamless and secure user experience.
- _Environment Variables_: Sensitive database credentials are stored securely using environment variables defined in a .env file.
- _Bootstrap for Styling_: We used Bootstrap 5 for styling elements of the user interface.
